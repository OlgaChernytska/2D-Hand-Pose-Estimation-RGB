# 2D Hand Pose Estimation from RGB Image

![Title](title.png)

## 1. Description
Repository includes working PyTorch pipeline to train a model and make inference.

Here are my tutorials that explain it in details: 

- [Gentle introduction to 2D Hand Pose Estimation: Approach Explained](https://notrocketscience.blog/gentle-introduction-to-2d-hand-pose-estimation-approach-explained/)
- Gentle introduction to 2D Hand Pose Estimation: Let's Code it!


For this project, open-source FreiHAND dataset is used. Download it [here](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FreihandDataset.en.html).


## 2. Repository Content

Repository has the following files:

- Train Notebook.ipynb (notebook to train a model)
- Inference Notebook.ipynb (notebook for inferences)
- utils/model.py (model class)
- utils/dataset.py (dataset class to load FreiHAND dataset)
- utils/trainer.py (class to train model)
- utils/prep_utils.py (supplementary functions)
- model_final (trained model weights)
- requirements.txt (required packages & versions)
